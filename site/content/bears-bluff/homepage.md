The Bears Bluff National Fish Hatchery serves as a part of the  Warmwater Fisheries and Aquatic Conservation Program in  the South Atlantic-Gulf Region of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The coastal location of the 31-acre facility along the banks of the North Edisto River in South Carolina provides an ideal site to investigate culture techniques for a wide variety of freshwater, saltwater and anadromous (fish that migrate from saltwater to fresh) aquatic species.

## Programs

Bears Bluffâ€™s programs focus on fishery conservation efforts with Atlantic sturgeon, American shad, red drum, and imperiled freshwater mussels, as well as habitat improvement projects related to both saltmarsh and freshwater ecosystems.

## Goals

- Restore and manage interjurisdictional coastal and riverine fishes, such as the American shad, anadromous sturgeon, and red drum.
- Aid recovery of species listed under the Endangered Species Act, such as the Atlantic sturgeon and American chaffseed, and candidate species such as the Carolina gopher frog.
- Pioneer and develop culture techniques for both freshwater and saltwater species.
- Develop hatchery product evaluation techniques.
- Enhance and restore fish habitat in both coastal and freshwater systems.

## Species viewing availability

- American shad: Most work is performed in the field, but may be viewed at the hatchery as eggs or fry between March and May.
- Atlantic sturgeon: Can be observed year round. Possible eggs and newly hatched fry available for viewing in August and September.
- Red drum: Held September to November. Fry are grown out in production ponds and then stocked in surrounding areas. Production ponds may be viewed but the fish are not available for viewing.
- Carolina gopher frog: Eggs are collected, hatched, and tadpoles are available for viewing  between February and July.
- Savannah lilliput: May be seen on station between May and August.
