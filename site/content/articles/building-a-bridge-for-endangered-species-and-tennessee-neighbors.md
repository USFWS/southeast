The Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program helps landowners conserve habitat for threatened and endangered species. But what if it could also help frustrated neighbors and resource-strapped counties?

Last year the Tennessee Partnersâ€™ program joined with a bevy of county, state and federal agencies to remove a particularly troublesome fish barrier on a Campbell County stream. Hatfield Creek is home to the federally endangered Cumberland darter, federally threatened blackside dace, and the at-risk Cumberland arrow darter. It also floods several times a year, washing away the old road crossing and leaving nearby residents stranded.

Starting in January 2020, and armed with $50,000 in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service fish passage money, the crew got busy. (The Partners program chipped in $3,000). Campbell County and the Tennessee Department of Transportation also contributed cash, materials and manpower for the project. The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency provided in-kind assistance.

Seven undersized culverts were removed and a spanning arch bridge was installed. The project was completed in June 2020. Flood waters now readily pass through the culverts. Fish and other aquatic organisms move more freely on the all-natural stream bottom. 

Success breeds success, or at least another chance to conserve species while helping folks. The Partners, along with Campbell County and Tennessee wildlife officials, have identified two other troubled fish barriers threatening blackside dace in need of replacement.
