Cedar Key, Florida – Hurricane Sally’s outer winds were blowing hard, churning two-foot waves as Larry Woodward beached the skiff on Atsena Otie Key. The island, rich in history and wildlife, is disappearing, succumbing steadily to rising seas and hellacious storms that pummel the historic mills, cemetery and bird-loving habitats.
The race was on. To get on and off the key before the Gulf became unnavigable. And, to preserve what remains of the Native American, colonial, military and industrial histories. Atsena Otie -- “Cedar Island” in the language of the Muscogee – is part of the Lower Suwannee and Cedar Keys National Wildlife Refuges.
“It’s important to protect this island as best we can, at least the cultural aspects of it,” says Woodward, the deputy refuge manager, while following the oak-, pine- and saw palmetto-lined path to the cemetery. “It’s got a lot of history to it and we need to protect those resources. It all ties into our mission.”
Its history will inform Florida’s future too, especially the coastal communities like Cedar Key sitting in the climactic crosshairs of sea level rise and evermore damaging storms. 
“Atsena Otie is showing us the future of what Cedar Key will look like,” says Ken Sassaman, an archaeologist at the University of Florida who’s spearheading an ambitious virtual reality project to reconstruct island life. “It’s time is not infinite. There’ll be a time when it’s inhospitable because of sea level rise and storms. If it’s not abandoned, they’ll have to re-engineer the place.”
"Breaks my heart”
Woodward reached the cemetery perched on the key’s highest ground and encircled by oaks, palms  and red bay swaying in the occasional breeze. The infamously voracious mosquitoes had disappeared. A lagoon, favored by fishers and kayakers, sat just below.
“This is the one that just breaks my heart,” Woodward says standing over Georgia Lewis’ 1894 tombstone. “She was just twenty-six years old.  She died at childbirth. Her child died three months later.”
William Lewis’ smaller headstone sat alongside his mother’s.
Life was never easy in the malarial, storm-wracked keys and coves where the mighty Suwannee River empties into the Gulf, about an hour west of Gainesville. (Atsena Otie is owned by the local water management district, yet managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.) Native Americans first inhabited the island more than 2,000 years ago only to succumb to European diseases and U.S. Army muskets.

If all goes as planned, the Red Hills sallie will one day be fully recovered and removed from the threatened and endangered species list. The Service’s $9 million award, funded via Recovery Land Acquisition grants, will go a long ways toward the salamander’s survival. Alabama's Forever Wild Land Trust provided the remainder of the matching funds to seal the deal earlier this year.

“These very important land acquisitions continue the work that we, and our partners, began several years ago to acquire enough land to conserve habitat for the long-term success of the Red Hills salamander,” said Chris Blankenship, ADCNR Commissioner. “This project is proof that partnerships between state and federal agencies, conservation groups, and industry are vital to conservation efforts throughout the country.”

Other at risk and T&E species, including the Bachman’s sparrow, red-cockaded woodpecker, gopher tortoise and southern hognose snake, should also benefit from the conserved lands. As will the public, hunters in particular, once the complex becomes a wildlife management area sometime next year. 

In addition to the state and federal partners, The Nature Conservancy, Conservation Resources, and the Brown-Schutt Trust helped make the land conservation deal a reality. The conservancy, for example, has worked two decades to protect the Red Hills of Alabama.

“We are thrilled to celebrate the conservation of over 11,000 acres, and the opportunity to open this land to the people of Alabama,” said Mitch Reid, the conservancy’s director in Alabama.
