The U.S Fish and Wildlife’s Coastal Program has been partnering with Florida State Parks and the Atlanta Botanical Garden to help the pitcher plant by letting the sun shine in.

Over the past nine years, more than 1,500 acres of wetland communities along the Florida panhandle have benefitted from the habitat restoration work.

These native herbaceous wetland communities are home to carnivorous bog plants, orchids, and other rare and at-risk plants that provide habitat for the endangered reticulated flatwoods salamander. Over time, as development increased and fire decreased, forests out-shaded, out-competed, and outlasted the rare, sun-worshipping bog plants. Tall, dense, closed-canopy stands of woody vegetation proliferated, tipping the balance from herbaceous understory with scattered shrubs to a formidable fortress of trees, primarily titi. Titi is an invasive shrub that grows to tree height and forms thick forests. The resulting shade reduces salamander pond habitat, which is especially important for breeding and larval rearing.

Impenetrable titi forests can also alter the surface and subsurface hydrology of the coastal dune lake watershed by diminishing natural submarine groundwater discharge into Gulf of Mexico (thereby also diminishing water quality), and increasing transpiration into the air. These critically imperiled lakes are unique bodies of water found only in Madagascar, Australia, New Zealand, Oregon, and Walton County, Florida, where 15 named coastal dune lakes intermittently connect to the Gulf through “outfalls” along 26 miles of coastline. A huge volume of water that should be naturally seeping its way through coastal dune lake watershed and salamander habitat gets lost to atmosphere instead of flowing into the Gulf.

The partners have used a scalpel approach to identify and prioritize polygons of wall-to-wall titi, and mechanical remove them. This is followed by secondary removal of re-sprouting titi and frequent prescribed fire, then letting nature accelerate recovery. All woody biomass was chipped and moved off-site to further accelerate restoration and soil recovery to its historical composition, characterized by low organic content. Carnivorous plants thrive in nutrient-poor soils because they can digest bugs and out-compete other plants that must get their nutrients from soil.

The Atlanta Botanical Garden does the rare plant propagation for re-introduction. The partnership leveraged more than $7 million through the National Fish & Wildlife Foundation’s Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund, greatly expanding ongoing restoration work at coastal state parks.

In August 2016, wildlife cameras captured images of a sphinx moth pollinating a white fringed orchid at one park transplant site.

Wetland restoration of this nature and magnitude is not a cookie-cutter process. There are no intact seepage slope reference sites left, and there is no restoration how-to manual. Until now, as our partners write chapters about how to recover future seepage slope and wet prairie habitat.
