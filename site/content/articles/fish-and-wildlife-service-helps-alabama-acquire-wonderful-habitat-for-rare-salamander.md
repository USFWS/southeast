**Monroeville, Alabama** -- The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources celebrated Thursday the acquisition of nearly 5,000 acres for the federally threatened Red Hills salamander. 

The purple, translucent, lungless sallie isn’t the only creature to benefit from the newly conserved habitat. People who like to hunt, fish, hike, bike and bird watch, too, will be able to recreate on the south Alabama land. Combined with previously protected lands at the Forever Wild Red Hills Complex, the public will be able to roam 11,000 acres of rolling pinelands.

The Service awarded $9 million in endangered species recovery grants – the largest ever distributed in the Southeast – to Alabama for Red Hills conservation.

“This project is an excellent example of focused work, all of us working together to recover listed and at risk species,” said Leo Miranda-Castro, regional director for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the South Atlantic-Gulf & Mississippi-Basin. “None of this would be possible without our trusted partners and state colleagues, who make up the ‘secret sauce’ for this amazing conservation success.” 

The salamander lives along a narrow band in the Red Hills region. It is found nowhere else in the world. It is rather large, up to 10 inches, but chances of finding one are slim. The sallie only comes out of its burrow at night in search of crickets, spiders and earthworms. 

It was listed as federally threatened in 1977 due largely to loss of habitat. A generation later, school kids in Fairhope successfully lobbied state officials to designate the salamander as the state’s official amphibian.

If all goes as planned, the Red Hills sallie will one day be fully recovered and removed from the threatened and endangered species list. The Service’s $9 million award, funded via Recovery Land Acquisition grants, will go a long ways toward the salamander’s survival. Alabama's Forever Wild Land Trust provided the remainder of the matching funds to seal the deal earlier this year.

“These very important land acquisitions continue the work that we, and our partners, began several years ago to acquire enough land to conserve habitat for the long-term success of the Red Hills salamander,” said Chris Blankenship, ADCNR Commissioner. “This project is proof that partnerships between state and federal agencies, conservation groups, and industry are vital to conservation efforts throughout the country.”

Other at risk and T&E species, including the Bachman’s sparrow, red-cockaded woodpecker, gopher tortoise and southern hognose snake, should also benefit from the conserved lands. As will the public, hunters in particular, once the complex becomes a wildlife management area sometime next year. 

In addition to the state and federal partners, The Nature Conservancy, Conservation Resources, and the Brown-Schutt Trust helped make the land conservation deal a reality. The conservancy, for example, has worked two decades to protect the Red Hills of Alabama.

“We are thrilled to celebrate the conservation of over 11,000 acres, and the opportunity to open this land to the people of Alabama,” said Mitch Reid, the conservancy’s director in Alabama.
