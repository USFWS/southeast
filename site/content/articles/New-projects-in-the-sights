When he learned that lawmakers had approved a funding change in a segment of the Wildlife Sport Fish Restoration Act (WSFR), Randy Spencer was quick to share the news with regional partners.  

They didn’t hesitate to take advantage of the change, either. Now, firearms enthusiasts in Georgia, North Carolina and Kentucky are the first in the nation to enjoy new or enhanced shooting ranges. A fourth proposal in Mississippi is likely to get the go-ahead, too.  

Spencer, a WSFR grant specialist who works in the Service’s Atlanta regional office, worked with his state counterparts in acquiring funding from TARMARK, the Target Practice and Marksmanship Training Support Act. Approved last year, the act took effect this fiscal year. It authorizes the federal government to offer up to 90 percent of the cost of a shooting-range project, with participating states providing the remaining 10 percent.   

This is offered through a federal law dating to 1937, when Congress passed the Pittman-Robertson  Act. It directed money from the taxes on the sale of firearms and ammunition to be set aside to fund wildlife restoration, as well as creating a 75-25 funding match.   

The shooting range act approved last year sweetens the deal for states by reducing the state match to 10 percent.  

The projects in Georgia, North Carolina and Kentucky are good news for shooters, said Spencer.  

“They may be moving dirt and building stuff as we speak,” he said.  

Work is already underway at the Mike Commander Shooting Range near Albany, Georgia. Total cost of the project, about 180 miles south of Atlanta: nearly $2.8 million, with the federal government picking up 90 percent of the cost. It should be complete in November.  

Range improvements include improving the archery course to feature life-sized likenesses of wild game, said Water Lane, assistant chief of game management for the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.  

“We’re improving it, expanding it,” he said. “It’ll accommodate a lot more people.”  

A project in North Carolina is not far behind. In April, officials with the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission learned that their application for a new, $2.5 million range north of Asheville had been approved.   

The range is located in a region that lacked a comparable facility, said Jessie Birckhead, the commission’s land acquisition and grant manager. “It’s been really well received so far,” she said.  

In a public hearing in which the commission proposed the range, “we got nothing but positive feedback,” she said.  

And, earlier this month, a project to build a range at Veterans Memorial Wildlife Management Area in Georgetown, Kentucky, got the OK. It will cost $2.3 million, with the federal government funding the lion’s share, to build a facility about 10 miles north of Lexington.  

Meantime, Spencer anticipates getting an application to expand a range in Mississippi, too.  

“There’s an awful lot of folks shooting these days,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of folks needing shooting ranges.”

Call this the story of the one that got away – not by wiggling out of a net or snapping a line, but by prospering.

Scientists recently proposed that Ouachita madtom, a whiskery fish found in Arkansas, be removed from a petition that had called for its protection under the Endangered Species Act.

The Center for Biological Diversity seven years ago proposed that the fish be protected. It said recently it would remove that fish and 16 others species it had sought to be protected.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the Service) recently removed them from its work plan – proof that the species are doing far better than originally thought.

The species’ removal is but the latest indication that scores of plants and animals across the Southeast are maintaining – and, in some cases, thriving.

In the past five years, the Service has discovered that 95 species – fish, wildlife and plants – don’t need the federal act’s protection. In addition, the populations of 13 species have so improved that they’re now classified as threatened rather than endangered.  Some including the Louisiana black bear have stepped off the list entirely fully recovered.

In the latest decision, the recommendations grew from two meetings – one that reviewed the status of 10 plants, the other focusing on animals.

Last fall, the Southeast Partners in Plant Conservation, a group comprising specialists from a handful of southern states, took a hard look at the 10 plants. Biologists in the National Fisheries Council reviewed the remaining five animal species.

Their recommendations: The 17 species were okay, and didn’t need federal protection. The Service concurred, happily.

“Withdrawal of species from the petition reduces the Service’s workload and frees up resources for higher-priority species,” said Mike Harris, the At-Risk Species Coordinator for the Service’s Southeast Region.

Striking the species from the petition means good things can happen when agencies share their expertise, said Jennifer Cruse-Sanders, Vice President of Science and Conservation at the Atlanta Botanical Garden. The garden hosted the SePPCon meeting.

“It just goes to show how important it is to bring everyone together in one place to build our conservation network, share information and set priorities,” she said. “I think this network will continue to grow.”

Jon Ambrose, of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, shares his opinion.

‘It’s a good thing,” said Ambrose, who heads the department’s Nongame Conservation Section. “It’s an encouraging sign that we can work together and get an actual picture of the status of these species.”

The species range from finned to leafy, beginning with Ouachita madtom. Only scientists call it that. Nearly everyone else calls it by a more universal moniker: catfish.

It’s more kitten than cat. The Ouachita madtom doesn’t reach 3 inches in length. It’s found only in the upper forks of the Arkansas’ Saline River.

Other species removed from the petition are three types of freshwater mussels – the Apalachicola floater, warrior pigtoe and Savanna Lilliput.
In addition, the Saline burrowing crayfish and the Succarnoochee River crayfish no longer are on the petition.

Rounding out the animal species is the one-toed Amphiuma. True to its name, this amphibian, found from Georgia to Mississippi, has but one toe on each foot. They aren’t big: One longer than 8 inches is a bragging-size find.

The plants removed from the petition are narrowleaf Carolina scalystem, bighorn hornwort, gorge leafy liverwort, Cumberland reed grass, bear tupelo, west Florida cow lily, variable leaf Indian plantain, southern racemose goldenrod, Piedmont barren strawberry and Sharp’s leafy liverwort.
