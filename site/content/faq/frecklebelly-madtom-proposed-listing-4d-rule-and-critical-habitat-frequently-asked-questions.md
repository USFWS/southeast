Q: What is the frecklebelly madtom and where does it occur?   

The frecklebelly madtom is a small, stout catfish that inhabits the main channels and tributaries of medium to large river systems in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee. The fish has a broad but scattered distribution across the Pearl River and Mobile Basin drainages. Throughout its range, the frecklebelly madtom primarily occupies streams and rivers within the Gulf Coastal Plain province.  However, it also occurs in the upland areas of the Ridge and Valley province in the Conasauga River and Piedmont Upland province in the Etowah River.   

Q: What action is the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service taking?   

After reviewing the best available peer-reviewed science, we have determined that a distinct population segment of the species, located in the Upper Coosa River, warrants listing as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) with critical habitat.  We are also proposing a 4(d) rule which includes exceptions to incidental take prohibitions resulting from projects that may benefit the species.  

Q: What is a distinct population segment? 

Under the ESA, a distinct population segment (DPS) is a vertebrate population or group of populations that is discrete from other populations of the species and significant in relation to the entire species.  After reviewing the best scientific information, we determined that the Upper Coosa River frecklebelly madtom populations (unit) in Georgia and Tennessee represent a DPS and that it warranted listing as a DPS.  This DPS occupies the rivers and streams that join to form the Coosa River. 

By listing a DPS, the Service applies the ESA's protections only to the deteriorating portion of a species' range.  Listing distinct population segments allows the Service to protect and conserve species and the ecosystems upon which they depend before a largescale decline occurs that would necessitate the ESA’s protections throughout a species’ entire range.  

Q: Why is the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposing to list the frecklebelly madtom as threatened?  

Poor water quality resulting from land development and agriculture use poses the largest risk to this DPS of the frecklebelly madtom in the Upper Coosa River.  These stressors put this DPS at risk of being endangered in the foreseeable future.  Other potential stressors include channelization, dams, and impoundments. 

Q: Why isn’t the Service proposing to list the entire range as threatened? 

The Service prepared a Species Status Assessment, a comprehensive compilation of the best available scientific and commercial information, which was then peer reviewed.  We determined that listing the frecklebelly madtom as an endangered or a threatened species throughout all or a significant portion of its entire range is not warranted.  However, we found the Upper Coosa River representation unit of the frecklebelly madtom discrete and significant under the DPS policy.  After determining this, the Service then evaluated the status of the Upper Coosa River DPS and found that listing is warranted in Georgia and Tennessee.  Accordingly, we are proposing to list the Upper Coosa River DPS of the frecklebelly madtom as a threatened species. 

Q: What is the proposed critical habitat designation for the frecklebelly madtom?   

The proposed critical habitat designation for the Upper Coosa River DPS of the frecklebelly madtom consists of 134 stream miles of occupied habitat in two units in Georgia and Tennessee. Proposed critical habitat does not include riparian areas, only instream habitat to the high water mark.  Unit 1 consists of 51.5 stream miles of the Conasauga River beginning from the mouth of Coahulla Creek on the border between Whitfield and Murray counties, Georgia, continuing upstream to the mouth of Graham Branch in Polk County, Tennessee.  Unit 2 consists of 82.5 stream miles of the Etowah River, beginning at its confluence with Shoal Creek in Cherokee County, Georgia, continuing upstream to 0.5 miles upstream of where the Etowah River crosses Jay Bridge Road in Lumpkin County, Georgia.  Both units are occupied by the species and contain most of the physical or biological features essential to its conservation.  

Both units of critical habitat overlap with multiple listed species, including the amber and trispot darters and freshwater mussels like the southern clubshell and fine-lined pocketbook.  No other river basin in North America has a higher percentage of endemic species as the Upper Coosa River, which researchers call a “globally significant biological treasure.”

How does the proposed critical habitat designation look on a map?  

{{< figure class="photo-center" src="/images/pages/frecklebelly-madtom-habitat-map.jpg" alt="Map of habitat area for frecklebelly madtom" >}}

Proposed designation of critical habitat for the Upper Coosa River DPS of frecklebelly madtom with units, riparian ownership, and length of units.

| Unit               | Riparian Ownership                                          | Stream Miles | Stream Kilometers |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1: Conasauga River | Private, Private Conservation Parcels, State Lands, Federal | 51.5         | 83                |
| 2: Etowah River    | Private, Private Conservation Parcels, State Lands, Federal | 82.5         | 133               |

What is critical habitat?   

The Service has the authority to identify critical habitat when it proposes to list an animal or plant as endangered or threatened.  Critical habitat is identified based on what an animal or plant needs to survive and reproduce by reviewing the best scientific information concerning a  species’ present and historical ranges, habitat and biology.  

The designation of critical habitat helps ensure federal agencies and the public are aware of the habitat needs of the frecklebelly madtom and proper consultation is conducted by federal agencies when required by law.  

The designation will have no impact on private landowners taking actions on their land that do not require federal funding or permits.  

What does a critical habitat designation do?   

When an area is designated as critical habitat for a listed species, federal agencies are required to ensure that any action they fund, authorize or carry out is not likely to result in the destruction of the habitat.  This is carried out through consultation with the Service under Section 7 of the ESA. This only affects projects that require a federal permit or other actions funded or conducted by a federal agency.   

The designation of critical habitat does not affect land ownership or establish a refuge, wilderness, reserve, preserve or other conservation area.  A critical habitat designation also does not allow the government or public to access private lands, nor does it require implementation of restoration, recovery or enhancement measures by non-federal landowners.  

What is a 4(d) rule? 

For a threatened species, the Service may use flexibility provided under the ESA’s Section 4(d) to tailor the take prohibitions to accommodate those actions that may provide conservation benefits for the species; referred to as a 4(d) rule.  The ESA allows for 4(d) rules that are “necessary and advisable” for the conservation of the species.  This targeted approach can reduce ESA conflicts by allowing some activities to continue that may benefit the madtom and do not significantly harm it, while focusing our efforts on the threats that slow species recovery.  These customized protections of the ESA minimize regulatory burden while maximizing the likelihood of recovery of a threatened plant/animal.  

How does the 4(d) rule affect activities occurring in the frecklebelly madtom’s habitat? 

The proposed 4(d) rule would provide exceptions to incidental take resulting from the following:  channel restoration projects, streambank restoration projects, and activities carried out under programs like the Natural Resource Conservation Service’s (NRCS) [Working Lands for Wildlife](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/programs/initiatives/?cid=stelprdb1046975) (WLFW) program or similar projects.   

How do I submit comments on this proposal?  

The public is invited to submit written comments on the proposal to list the frecklebelly madtom, the proposal to designate critical habitat, and the proposed 4(d) rule up to 60 days from its November 19, 2020 publication in the Federal Register.  Please submit comments by January 19, 2021.  The Service will post all comments on [https://www.regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov).  This generally means the agency will post any personal information provided through the process.  

All relevant information received during the open comment period from the public, government agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested parties will be considered and addressed in the Service’s final listing determination, 4(d) rule and critical habitat designation for the frecklebelly madtom.  

The complete listing proposal can be obtained by visiting the Federal eRulemaking Portal: [https://www.regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov) at Docket Number FWS–R4–ES–2020-0058.   

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX## What action is the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service taking?

Based on a review of the best available information and full status assessment, the Service is proposing to list the [trispot darter](/wildlife/fishes/trispot-darter) as threatened under the [Endangered Species Act (ESA)](/endangered-species-act).

## What does it mean when a species is threatened? 

A species is listed in one of two categories: endangered or threatened.  An endangered species is one that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.  A threatened species is one that is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.  The Service is proposing to designate the trispot darter as threatened. 

## What prompted the Service to take this action?

On April 20, 2010, the Service received a petition from the Center for Biological Diversity and others to list 404 aquatic species, including the trispot darter, in the southeastern United States. In response to the petition, the Service completed a partial 90-day finding on September 27, 2011, in which it determined that the petition contained substantial information that a listing may be warranted for the darter.  The Service then conducted a status review as a part of the ESA’s 12-month finding process.

## What are the criteria for deciding whether to add a species to the endangered and threatened species list?

A species is added to the list when it is determined to be endangered or threatened because of the following factors:

  - The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range;
  - Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes;
  - Disease or predation;
  - The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or,
  - Other natural manmade factors affecting its survival.

## How are those factors determined?

Before the Service can propose to list a species, biologists must first conduct a Species Status Assessment (SSA) report.  The SSA is an in-depth review of the species’ biology and threats, an evaluation of its biological status, and an assessment of the resources and conditions needed to maintain long-term viability. The intent is for the SSA to be easily updated as new information becomes available and to support all functions of the Endangered Species Program from candidate assessment to listing to consultations to recovery.  The SSA is a living document upon which other documents, such as listing rules, recovery plans, and five-year reviews, would be based if the species warrants listing under the ESA.

## How long has the Service been using SSAs in the listing process?

2017 is the first year the Service implemented the SSA framework when considering whether a species needs ESA protection.  [Learn more about Species Status Assessments](https://www.fws.gov/endangered/improving_esa/ssa.html).

## What threats were identified for the trispot darter?

### Reduced connectivity

Numerous natural features can limit or prevent fish movement, such as beaver dams and waterfalls, as well as manmade structures that prevent fish movement. Structures installed at road crossings (bridges and culverts), dams, and pipelines all have the potential to act as barriers to fish movement, block exchange of genetic material between populations, increase a population’s vulnerability to local extinction, and prevent recolonization after local extinction has occurred.

### Changes in waterflow

These changes can include increases or decreases in storm flow frequency and intensity and a decrease in base flows. Activities that lead to such changes include reservoir construction and operation, surface water and groundwater withdrawals, and increasing the presence of impervious surfaces - such as paving parking lots, constructing houses, and removing trees which are all associated with urbanization. A hydropower dam, Carters Dam, exists on the Coosawattee River on the boundary of the Ridge and Valley and Blue Ridge ecoregions. Hydropeaking is a form of flow regulation which introduces frequent, short duration, artificial flow events to the river.   Non-hydropeaking reservoirs, farm ponds, recreational lakes, and other impoundments may substantially alter flows by storing water during low flow periods. Unlike hydropeaking reservoirs, this somewhat reduces the negative impacts of quickly rising and falling water levels from hydropower generation. These types of reservoirs can also reduce base flows which reduce the habitat available to darters.

### Channel modification

Channel modification can include channelization, piping, in-stream construction, in-stream mining, and reservoir creation. Channelization includes straightening, deepening, or widening of streams and rivers for flood control, drainage improvement, navigation, and relocation. Channel modification can lead to a loss of essential trispot habitat components, or completely destroy the habitat.

### Urbanization

Urbanization is expected to affect the trispot darter because the majority of known darter locations are in close vicinity to growing metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Chattanooga, Birmingham, and other areas with growing populations and increasing development. The negative effects of urbanization include increases in stormwater runoff, primarily from an increase in impervious surfaces (paving), an increase in chemical runoff like herbicides and pesticides from lawn, and increases in sedimentation from tree removal.

### Loss of plants along river margins and stream banks

Removal of these plants can destabilize stream banks, cause increases in stream sedimentation and turbidity, cause an increase in water temperatures because of the amount of light that is now reaching the water.  There are numerous pastures where livestock have access to streams which have been identified as spawning habitat for the trispot darter in the Little Canoe Creek watershed.  Livestock accessing these buffers leads to an increased concern for water quality and habitat destruction. Livestock accessing streams also destabilize stream banks which creates increased sediment loads within these small systems.

### Sedimentation

A wide range of activities can lead to sedimentation within streams including agriculture, construction activities, stormwater runoff, unpaved roads, forestry activities, utility crossings, dredging, and even historic land use.  Within the range of the trispot darter, sedimentation is occurring due to urban impacts in the Springville, Alabama, and Dalton, Georgia, areas, agricultural practices in the Conasauga River basin, and livestock access to streams in the Little Canoe Creek watershed.

## Water quality and non-point source pollution

### Contaminants

Contaminants, including metals, hydrocarbons, pesticides and other potentially harmful organic and inorganic compounds, are common in urban streams and may be partially responsible for the absence of sensitive fish in those systems. These include wastewater treatment plants, mines, and industrial facilities. Non-point sources are more difficult to pinpoint. Pesticides are frequently found in streams draining agricultural lands, with herbicides being the most commonly detected.
Poultry Litter - Poultry litter is a mixture of chicken manure, feathers, spilled food, and bedding material that frequently is used to fertilize pastureland or row crops. A broiler house containing 20,000 birds will produce approximately 150 tons of litter a year. Surface-spreading of litter allows runoff from heavy rains to carry nutrients from manure into nearby streams. Repeated or over application of poultry litter, in addition, can result in phosphorus buildup in the soil.

Because of these threats, the trispot darter only survives in four of the twelve watersheds where it is known to occur.

## What does the trispot darter look like?

The Trispot darter is a small bodied fish with a complete lateral line, single anal spine, and scaled cheeks. Adult males and females range in size from 1.3 to 1.6 inches, and the body is slender to moderately stout. The darter has three prominent black dorsal saddles, pale undersurface, and a dark bar below the eye. Scattered dark blotches exist on the fin rays. During breeding season, males are a reddish-orange color and have green marks along their sides and a red band through their spiny dorsal fin.

## Where does the trispot darter live and what unique characteristics does it require of its environment for survival?

The trispot darter is known to occur in Little Canoe Creek and tributaries (including Gin Branch), Ballplay Creek tributaries, Conasauga River and tributaries (including Holly, Coahulla, and Mill (Georgia) creeks, and a Mill Creek (Tennessee) tributary,) and Coosawattee River and a tributary (including Salacoa Creek). 
Non-breeding habitat is small to medium river margins and lower reaches of tributaries with slower water flow and is associated with plant matter, logs, small cobbles, pebbles, gravel, and often a fine layer of silt.

Breeding sites are seasonally wet seepage areas and or ditches with little to no flow; shallow depths, moderate leaf litter covering mixed cobble, gravel, sand, clay and emergent vegetation.

## What do trispot darters eat?

They mainly eat fly larvae and pupae (an insect in its immature form between larva and adult), as well as mayfly nymphs.

## Where was the trispot darter found before it was proposed as a threatened species?

The trispot darter has a historical range from the middle to upper Coosa River Basin; specifically, from Cowans Creek, a tributary to the Coosa River, and Johns and Woodward creeks, tributaries to the Oostanaula River.

## What will this listing mean for poultry farmers?

We anticipate no new regulations for poultry farmers. Instead, they are encouraged to follow best management practices that are already in place.
