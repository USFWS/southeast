## Information on attending the virtual public hearing

The USFWS has scheduled a virtual public hearing on Wednesday, May 12, 2021 from 6:00 – 8:00pm Atlantic Time (AT). This virtual public hearing is intended to give the public an opportunity to learn more about the proposed downlistings for the plant Eugenia woodburyana and Virgin Islands tree boa and comment on the proposed downlistings. The USFWS will hold the virtual public hearing via the Zoom online platform so that participants can attend remotely.

During the virtual public hearing, attendees can join by computer or phone to learn about the proposed downlistings. The virtual public hearing will start with a brief presentation by USFWS staff followed by an opportunity for attendees to provide their comments.  Commenters may have an allotted time period to provide comments.

In addition, written public comments can be submitted on [regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov), Docket no FWS-R4-ES-2019-0069 (Virgin Islands tree boa) and Docket no FWS-R4-ES-2019-070 (Eugenia woodburyana).  Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted and will be fully considered in preparation of the final rules.

We recommend that members of the public log into the Zoom hearing platform 5 minutes prior to the beginning of the presentation to ensure that they can connect. If using the phone-only option, participants will be able to listen to the virtual public hearing, but they will not view the presentation. Instructions will be given regarding how participants will be able to provide their comments.

For security purposes, registration is required. To listen and view the hearing via Zoom, listen to the hearing by telephone, or provide verbal public comment during the hearing by Zoom or telephone, you must register.

Interested members of the public not familiar with the Zoom platform should view the [Zoom video tutorials](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206618765-Zoom-video-tutorials) prior to the public hearing.
