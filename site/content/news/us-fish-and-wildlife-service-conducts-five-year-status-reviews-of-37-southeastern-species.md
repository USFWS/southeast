As part of the process mandated by the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will conduct [five-year status reviews](https://www.fws.gov/southeast/endangered-species-act/five-year-reviews/) of 37 endangered or threatened fish, wildlife, and plants.  These species are primarily found in the Southeastern United States and Puerto Rico, but are also known to occur in Delaware, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Texas, and Virginia. 

The public is invited to provide information and comments concerning these species on or before September 13, 2021. 

These five-year reviews will ensure listing classifications under the [ESA](https://www.fws.gov/southeast/endangered-species-act/) are accurate and recommend changes in status where appropriate based on the latest science and analysis.  In addition to reviewing the classification of these species, a five-year review presents an opportunity to track the species’ recovery progress. It may benefit species by providing valuable information to guide future conservation efforts.   

For several of the species included in this notice, the Service has Species Status Assessments (SSA) available for [download](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/). SSAs are rigorous assessments of a species' ability to maintain self-sustaining populations over time.  These assessments are based on the best available scientific and commercial information regarding life history, biology, and consideration of current and future vulnerabilities.  The result is a single document that delivers foundational science for informing all ESA decisions, including listing determinations, consultations, grant allocations, permitting, and recovery planning. 

Information gathered during a review can assist in making funding decisions, consideration related to reclassifying species status, conducting interagency consultations, making permitting decisions, and determining whether to update recovery plans, and other actions under the ESA. 

This notice announces our active review of 28 species listed here that are currently federally listed as endangered: 

## Endangered Fish and Wildlife: 
Puerto Rican parrot, Key deer, Cape Fear shiner, Alabama cavefish, Appalachian elktoe, white wartyback (pearlymussel), Alabama cave shrimp, Kentucky cave shrimp, and Miami tiger beetle. 

## Endangered Plants:
_Auerodendron pauciflorum_, small-anthered bittercress, Big Pine partridge pea, wedge spurge, Alabama leather flower, Apalachicola rosemary, _Cordia bellonis_, higüero de sierra, Harper's beauty, Roan Mountain bluet, sand flax, scrub lupine, _Myrcia paganii_, bariaco, wide-leaf warea, _Elaphoglossum serpens_, _Polystichum calderonense_, _Tectaria estremerana_, and Florida bristle fern. 

This notice announces our active review of nine species listed here that are currently federally listed as threatened: 

## Threatened Fish and Wildlife: 
Guajón, Kentucky arrow darter, West Indian manatee, Louisiana pearlshell, Suwannee moccasinshell, Squirrel Chimney Cave shrimp, and painted snake coiled forest snail. 

## Threatened Plants:
Blodgett’s silverbush and _Geocarpon minimum_. 

The five-year reviews seek information on:  (1) species biology, including population trends, distribution, abundance, demographics, and genetics; (2) habitat conditions, including amount, distribution, and suitability; (3) conservation measures that have been implemented; (4) threat status and trends; and, (5) other new information, data, or corrections, including taxonomic or nomenclatural changes; identification of erroneous information contained in the ESA list; and improved analytical methods.  Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection by appointment. 

The Federal Register notice announcing the status review of these 37 federally listed fish, wildlife and plants is available [online](www.regulations.gov); search for Docket #FWS–R4–ES–2021–N014.   

Written comments and information about them should be sent via e-mail or regular mail to [contacts listed here](/pdf/org-chart/contacts-for-five-year-review-two.pdf).
