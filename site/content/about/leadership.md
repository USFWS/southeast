Leopoldo “Leo” Miranda is the Southeast Regional Director of the Department of the Interior’s U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. He oversees the work of approximately 1,300 employees in carrying out the Federal Government’s partnership role in conserving fish, wildlife, and plant resources and their habitats within 10 southeastern states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Leo began his work with the Service as a Private Lands biologist in his native Puerto Rico, later becoming the Program Supervisor of the Service’s Chesapeake Bay Field Office in Annapolis, Maryland, followed by Assistant Regional Director of the Southeast Region’s Ecological Services Program. An advocate of public-private conservation partnerships, he points to the success of the shade-grown coffee industry as an example of how government organizations and private landowners can work together to achieve win/win outcomes for people and for wildlife. On any given weekend, you are likely to find Leo in a tree stand or by a river, hunting or fishing with his son, Pablo. Leo attributes much of their shared love of nature and commitment to conservation to the pursuit of these outdoor recreational pastimes. Leo holds a Bachelor of Science in Marine Biology from the University of Puerto Rico and a Master of Science in Zoology from North Carolina State University. He and his wife, Jessica, Pablo, and their four-legged family members live in Marietta, Georgia.

## Mara Lopez

### Business Manager

Mara joined the Service in 2016 as a Presidential Management Fellow (PMF). Her appointment began with the National Wildlife Refuge System in headquarters and led to working with the International Affairs Program and the Office of Business Management and Operations where she was converted into a project management role. In this capacity, she led a complex space consolidation project in Denver, Colorado, and worked on the JAO Project Management Team, supporting our reorganization of budget and administration to a centralized, shared services model. 

This reorganization led to new opportunities across the Service, including the creation of Regional Business Offices within the Office of Regional Director in each of the Service's eight regions. Mara began serving as the Regional Business Advisor in the South Atlantic Gulf and Mississippi Basin Interior Regions in October of 2019, tasked with guiding the Regional Business Office in Atlanta, Georgia. Under her direction, this small team of professional budget and administrative personnel advises the Regional Director, the Regional Directorate Team and their staff on business matters, provides budgetary support and guidance, evaluates various business and management practices for improvement and efficiencies, supports workforce initiatives, oversees internal controls, and manages regional office operations.

Prior to joining the Service, Mara spent about 10 years working in the private sector in marketing and communications. She holds an MBA in management and entrepreneurship from Baldwin Wallace University in Berea, Ohio and a BFA from the University of Akron in Ohio.

Mara enjoys spending time outdoors, hiking trails with her husband and their dog. She also is an avid gardener and loves to travel to national parks and refuges.

Catherine serves as the Assistant Regional Director for Ecological Services in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Southeast Region. She has been with the Service since 1998 and got her start through the Career Awareness Institute at Mescalero National Fish Hatchery in New Mexico before working at Uvalde National Fish Hatchery and San Marcos Fish Technology Center in the Southwest Region. She also served as Deputy Project Leader and Project Leader at the Panama City Field Office in the Southeast. Catherine especially enjoys working across Service programs and with a variety of partners in non-traditional ways and is an advocate of finding solutions to achieve mutual mission success.

Catherine grew up in a large family in San Antonio, Texas, and did not realize that careers in conservation existed prior to her first internship with the Service.  However, she quickly fell in love with the field and the mission. She is an advocate of continual learning and mentoring and working with diverse groups from all backgrounds to achieve innovative conservation success. Catherine loves spending time with her family: her husband, Craig and her three kids, a son in high school, daughter in middle school, and a one-year-old boy.  She can be found gardening, in the water paddleboarding or snorkeling, and watching and attending college football games in the fall.

An avid reader and practitioner of adaptive leadership, Catherine continually reminds herself that real growth is in the discomfort zone!  That being said, she thinks there is nothing wrong with taking time to seek a little comfort, respite, and self-care before tackling the next big challenge.

Daffny Pitchford is the Assistant Regional Director of External Affairs for the South Atlantic-Gulf and Mississippi Basin Interior Regions.

Her path to this position, to which she was named in late 2020, began in 1998. She’d recently graduated that year from North Carolina Central University with a degree in biology. When the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service offered her a spot in its Outstanding Scholar Program, Daffny said yes.

Her career has included several stops within the Service’s National Wildlife Refuge System. Daffny taught youth about all things wild in Virginia Beach as an Outdoor Recreation Planner. As an Assistant Refuge Supervisor, Daffny oversaw Refuge operations from Virginia to Maine. She also served as an Assistant Refuge Manager and Project Leader in the field. Moving to the Southeast, Daffny worked as both a Refuge Supervisor and Lead Division Chief.

No matter what job she has held, Daffny has been guided by a love for the natural world and a desire to help others. She brings that commitment to External Affairs, too.

In her latest position, Daffny wants to ensure that she and her colleagues are an extension of all other programs -- with a role in communicating the excellent accomplishments and stories of the people and events that make strides in conservation every day. She is excited about the potential External Affairs offers. Daffny is just as enthusiastic to work with other programs and lead what she calls “an amazing team.”

## David Viker

### Regional Chief, National Wildlife Refuge System

{{< figure class="photo-right" src="/images/pages/david-viker-bio-2021.jpg" alt="Man stands ankle-deep in blue water half-dressed in a wetsuit." >}}

*“In matters of style, swim with the current. In matters of principle, stand like a rock.”* -- Thomas Jefferson

David Viker is a 28-year veteran of the Service, starting his career in 1992 as a wildlife biologist trainee in what’s now the Migratory Bird Program.  While at the University of Florida, David was a volunteer at Lower Suwannee and Cedar Keys National Wildlife Refuges. David worked up refuge management ranks on five field stations in five states. Along the way, he earned a federal law enforcement commission, obtained a fire management wildfire “red card,” and operated an array of heavy equipment pieces to manage habitat. David moved up to the Atlanta Regional Office as a Deputy Refuge Supervisor, helping to lead several dozen refuges in four states.

David then stepped up as Regional Chief and then Assistant Regional Director of the Migratory Bird Program, working closely with states and other partners in the Joint Ventures System and system of Flyways to set migratory bird regulations. David returned to the National Wildlife Refuge System after more than five years with the Migratory Bird Program.
 
Since January 2011, David has served as an Assistant Regional Director and Regional Chief of the National Wildlife Refuge System, leading more than 650 permanent employees on 131 refuges in 10 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These refuges, visited by more than 17 million people annually, range from just a few acres for an endangered species to the 400,000-acre Okefenokee wilderness.
 
David’s areas of greatest professional interest include connecting wildlife habitats through landscape linkages, connecting people with nature, and compatibility and appropriate use policy.  David’s greatest passion, though, is helping others grow. He has served over the years as the regional youth programs coordinator; member of the Diversity Committee; he founded the regional Leadership Development Council; helped establish the E-4 Mentoring program; has taught several courses at the National Conservation Training Center; speaks frequently on the power of diversity; and helped coach the Advanced Leadership Development Program. 

David has been a volunteer youth sports coach for more than 40 teams, ages 4 to 18, in basketball, baseball, softball, track and field, and soccer. His favorite times are spent with his wife of 25 years and their four children, doing faith-based volunteering, fishing, canoeing, hiking, camping, hunting, and other outdoor activities.
