## Volunteer

Wolf Creek NFH relies heavily on volunteers to maintain facilities and provide services. Here, the contributions of volunteers are equivalent to nearly six additional full time employees per year.

There are many opportunities to volunteer with Wolf Creek NFH--whether thatâ€™s assisting in the Visitor Center or helping with fish production, volunteering during special events, or becoming a resident work camper.

### Work Camping Program

We rely on work camping volunteers to staff and maintain our Center and assist in outreach activities year-round. Minimum three month commitment preferred.

In exchange for 20-27 hours/person/week (summer) and 18-24 hours/person/week (winter), volunteers receive a full hook-up campsite on a large, level, gravel lot, with fire pit and picnic table, onsite laundry, and limited WiFi. Propane provided during winter.

Work camping volunteer duties include: serving as point of contact for visitors--answering questions/providing assistance; leading tours and helping with field trips; caring for live education animals; performing day-to-day operation of Center gift shop; stocking brochures and handouts; cleaning Center including restrooms; performing minor maintenance; helping to plan special events, workshops and other outreach programs.

Wolf Creek NFH sets in the Cumberland River valley, just below Wolf Creek Dam on Lake Cumberland. This area boasts stunning scenic views and offers plentiful wildlife observation opportunities. With Lake Cumberland, the Cumberland River, and Hatchery Creek in your backyard, it's certainly an angler's paradise. Nestled in the south central hills of Kentucky, this location proves to be central to many regional features including other federal and state lands, as well as private attractions, providing ample opportunity for day trips during your down time.
