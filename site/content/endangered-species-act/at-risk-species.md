**Update:** [Download the Draft Programmatic Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances for Louisiana pinesnake in Louisiana](/pdf/agreement/candidate-conservation-agreement-with-assurances/draft-programmatic-ccaa-for-louisiana-pinesnake-in-louisiana.pdf).

Listing a plant or animal as federally protected under the Endangered Species Act is proven to be successful in preventing extinction.

However, providing a plant or animal this level of protection is America’s last line of defense. There are tremendous opportunities for **voluntary conservation actions**, undertaken **before a species requires listing**, to preclude the need to list species and improve habitats for listed, at-risk and common species alike.

A plant or animal is considered **“at-risk”** when:

- It is proposed for listing as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act,
- It is a candidate species for listing, or
- It has been petitioned by a third party for listing.
