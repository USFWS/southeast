## Appearance

The red-cockaded woodpecker is a small bird measuring about 8 inches in length, identifiable by its white cheek patch and black and white barred back. The males have a few red feathers, called a cockade. These red feathers usually remain hidden underneath black feathers between the black crown and white cheek patch unless the male is disturbed or excited. Females lack the red cockade. Juvenile males have a red 'patch' in the center of their black crown. This patch disappears during the fall of their first year at which time their cockades appear.

## Diet

Diet consists mostly of insects in the egg, larvae and adult stages. These include beetles, ants, roaches, spiders and other insects found in or on pine trees. Fruits and seeds make up a small portion of the overall diet. Methods of foraging include flaking away bark and probing under the bark using their specialized forked tongue to extract insects. Large, older trees are preferred for foraging. In general, males forage on the limbs and upper trunk, while females forage on the trunk below the crown. This division of foraging area is most noticeable in winter when insect numbers are at their lowest and their activity slows due to cold weather, making it harder for them to detect prey. Differences in the foraging behavior of males and females may help to reduce competition between them when food is scarce.

Female red-cockaded woodpeckers have been [documented](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1368968) searching for bone bits on the forest floor and stuffing them in tree crevices. Zoologists say that is the first known instance of a bird’s hoarding something for its mineral, rather than caloric content. Calcium rich bone is not rare, but the birds probably seek it to ensure stronger eggshells. They stash it in a tree so they won’t have to eat on the ground where they are vulnerable to predators.

## Habitat

The red-cockaded woodpecker is a non-migratory, territorial bird that lives in cooperative breeding social units called groups. These groups chatter and call throughout the day, using a great variety of vocalizations. They are the only North American woodpecker that requires old, living pine trees to excavate roosts and nest cavities, usually in trees infected with a fungus known as red-heart disease. Cavities can take three years or more to excavate, and are occasionally abandoned and reoccupied.

Cavity trees tend to be in areas known as “clusters,” and may include one to 20 or more cavity trees on three to 60 acres. Clusters are made up of active (in use) and inactive (previously used) cavity trees within an area defended by a single group. Completed cavities that are being actively used have numerous, small resin wells which exude sap. The birds keep the sap flowing as a cavity defense mechanism against tree climbing predators.

Suitable nesting habitat for the red-cockaded woodpecker include pine stands, or pine-dominated pine/hardwood stands, with a low or sparse understory and ample old-growth pines. Trees must be more than 60 years old to be suitable for cavity construction.  Longleaf pine is preferred where available, but they frequently use other species such as loblolly, shortleaf, slash and pond pine.

The red-cockaded woodpecker plays a vital role in the intricate web of life of pine forests. Red-cockaded woodpeckers are primary cavity nesters, meaning they are responsible for the construction of cavities. In the Southern pine ecosystem there are many secondary cavity users that benefit from their work. They are considered a keystone species because their cavities contribute to the diversity of species in the forest.

At least 27 species of vertebrates have been documented using red-cockaded woodpecker  cavities, either for roosting or nesting. Species include insects, birds, snakes, lizards, squirrels and frogs. Many of these species only use the cavities that have been abandoned by the birds; abandonment usually occurs because the entrance tunnel was enlarged by pileated woodpeckers. Southern flying squirrels, red-bellied woodpeckers, red-headed woodpeckers, Eastern bluebirds, brown-headed nuthatches, tufted titmice and great crested flycatchers are the species most commonly seen in cavities, and can use normal, unenlarged cavities that the birds could also use.}

## Historic range

The birds originally inhabited the open, fire-maintained pine forests of the southeast from New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia to Florida, west to Texas and north to portions of Oklahoma, Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky. The longleaf pine ecosystem initially disappeared from much of its original range because of early European settlement, widespread commercial timber harvesting and the turpentine industry. Commercial tree farming, fire-suppression, urbanization and agriculture contributed to further declines. Much of the current habitat is also different from historical pine forests in which these woodpeckers evolved. Today, many southern pine forests are young and with an absence of fire, that have become dense pine/hardwood forests unsuitable for the red-cockaded woodpecker.

## Current range

Today, the red-cockaded woodpecker is found in 11 states (AL, AR, FL, GA, LA, NC, MS, OK, SC, VA, and TX), and occurs on federal, state and private lands.

## Conservation challenges

- The loss of suitable habitat has caused the number of red-cockaded woodpeckers to decline by almost 99% since the time of European settlement. The primary habitat of the species in the longleaf pine ecosystem, has been reduced to 3% of its original expanse.
- Habitat fragmentation caused by land-use development and incompatible forest management practices.
- Small population sizes.
- Stochastic events such as hurricanes, ice storms, and wildfires, which are particularly problematic given the high number of very small woodpecker populations.
- Lack of natural fire or insufficient prescribed fire, which is important in maintaining this type of ecosystem and to prevent encroachment of fire-intolerant hardwoods leading to cluster abandonment.
- Restoring forest habitat to a suitable condition and providing artificial cavities until pines become sufficiently old for natural cavity excavation.
- The red-cockaded woodpecker is a conservation-reliant species; populations will decline without active and continuous management.  This includes:
    - Reliance on artificial cavities due to the absence of sufficient old pines for natural cavity excavation.
    - Reliance on continued habitat treatments (such as prescribed fire) to establish and maintain the open, pine-savannah conditions favored by the species.

## Partnerships, research and projects

Working with conservation partners, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) revised the red-cockaded woodpecker recovery plan in 2003 featuring the participation of other federal and state agencies and private landowners. Many large landscapes that provide habitat are on federal land, the For example, the U.S. Department of Defense developed special management guidelines for the woodpeckers on national forests and military installations. From 2003, woodpecker populations increased by as much as 66 percent across  15 military installations.. These include Eglin Air Force Base (Florida), Fort Benning (Georgia), Fort Bragg (North Carolina), Fort Polk (Louisiana), Fort Stewart (Georgia), and Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune (North Carolina). Beneficial conservation management by private landowners are also conserving this species.  Over 450 private landowners in nine states are enrolled in the safe harbor program to voluntarily provide management sustaining more than 690 active clusters.  The development and implementation of effective management to increase red-cockaded populations is in response to substantial research on the ecology and habitat requirements for this species.

[Download the recovery plan](https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plan/030320_2.pdf). The goal of the Service’s red-cockaded woodpecker recovery program is to conserve the species and the ecosystem upon which it depends. Red-cockaded woodpeckers have increased in number range-wide in response to recovery and management programs, from an estimated 4,694 active clusters by 1995 to at least 7,800 today.

The Service administers recovery and consultation programs for the red-cockaded woodpecker in accordance with the Endangered Species Act through 13 Ecological Services field offices in 11 states. In addition, the Service works to ensure consistent application of recovery and conservation programs on federal, state, and private lands. The Service promotes conservation, restoration, and ecologically sound management of the longleaf pine and related ecosystems.
